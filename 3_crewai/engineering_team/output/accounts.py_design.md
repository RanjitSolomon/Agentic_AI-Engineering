# accounts.py Module Design

## Overview

The `accounts.py` module is designed to manage user accounts on a trading simulation platform. It enables operations such as account creation, fund deposits and withdrawals, share buying and selling, portfolio valuation, and transaction history. It will ensure that all account operations respect the constraints of financial balance and share availability.

## Class and Function Design

### Class: Account

The `Account` class will encapsulate data and operations related to a user's trading account.

#### Attributes:
- `user_id: str` - A unique identifier for the user.
- `balance: float` - The current cash balance of the account.
- `holdings: Dict[str, int]` - A dictionary mapping stock symbols to quantities of shares owned.
- `transactions: List[Tuple[str, str, int, float]]` - A list containing transaction records. Each record is a tuple consisting of transaction type, stock symbol, quantity, and price.
- `initial_deposit: float` - The initial amount of money deposited to the account.

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
  - Initializes a new account with the specified `user_id` and `initial_deposit`.

- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Adds funds to the account balance. Returns `True` if the operation is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Subtracts funds from the account balance. Ensures the operation would not result in a negative balance. Returns `True` if the operation is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Records a purchase of shares of a given `symbol` and `quantity`. Deducts the appropriate funds based on current share prices obtained via `get_share_price`. Ensures the operation is financially viable. Returns `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Records a sale of shares of given `symbol` and `quantity`. Adjusts the account balance accordingly, ensuring the operation only sells the user's holdings. Returns `True` if the sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculates and returns the total value of the user's portfolio based on current share prices.

- `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
  - Computes and returns the user's profit or loss since the initial deposit.

- `get_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`
  - Returns a dictionary of the user's current stock holdings.

- `get_transaction_history(self) -> List[Tuple[str, str, int, float]]`
  - Returns a list of all transactions performed by the user.

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
  - External function used to fetch the current price of a share. (Not implemented within the module, but necessary for share transactions.)

### Usage Example

The module defines an `Account` class which interacts with a trading simulation in the following manner:

```python
# Example usage of the Account class
account = Account(user_id="user123", initial_deposit=1000.0)
account.deposit(500.0)
account.withdraw(200.0)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 5)
account.sell_shares("AAPL", 2)

portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value()
profit_or_loss = account.get_profit_or_loss()
holdings = account.get_holdings()
transactions = account.get_transaction_history()
```

This design ensures a robust, clear, and efficient account management system ready for integration with larger trading simulation platforms. All financial operations are protected against overdraw and share mismanagement, and the use of the `get_share_price` function ensures real-time financial accuracy.
