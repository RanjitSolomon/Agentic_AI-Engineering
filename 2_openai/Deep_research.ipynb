       "\n",
       "**LangChain** is a versatile framework that enables developers to build applications by chaining together prompts, models, memory, and external tools. It supports multiple language models and integrates with various tools, facilitating the creation of complex workflows. Its modular design and extensive ecosystem make it a popular choice for developing custom AI applications. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**AutoGen**, developed by Microsoft, focuses on multi-agent systems and code automation. It allows agents to communicate in natural language, coordinating tasks such as planning, development, and review. This conversational approach simplifies the creation of collaborative AI systems, enhancing productivity and efficiency. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "**CrewAI** emphasizes multi-agent collaboration, enabling the creation of teams of AI agents with specialized roles. This framework is designed for complex workflows requiring coordination and task delegation, making it suitable for applications in logistics, resource planning, and collaborative problem-solving.

       "\n",
       "**LangGraph** extends LangChain by providing a graph-based structure for managing agent workflows. It supports complex stateful systems with advanced logic, including loops and conditional branching, and integrates with LangChainâ€™s tools and models. This framework is ideal for applications requiring precise, sequential task execution, such as healthcare or supply chain management.

       "**AutoAgent** offers a fully automated, zero-code framework for developing LLM agents. It enables users to create and deploy AI agents through natural language, making AI development accessible to those without technical expertise. Operating as an autonomous agent operating system, AutoAgent comprises components like agentic system utilities, an LLM-powered actionable engine, and a self-managing file system.
